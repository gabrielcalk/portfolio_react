                I'm Gabriel Cavalcante and <strong>I'm 20 years old.</strong><br/><br/>

                I am passionate about creating things, sharing knowledge and learning.<br/><br/>

                I've been investing in the stock market since I was 16 years old and I created my first company when I was <strong>just 18 years old.</strong><br/><br/>

                In this company, we reached a <strong>revenue of approximately $250,000 USD (75% of EBITDA) and with a team of 7 people, which I lead.</strong><br/><br/>

                The core of this company was to teach Brazilians to invest in the global investment market and I was not only one of the professors but also the head of marketing and manager of the company.<br/><br/>

                I left the company after 2 years of operation due to lack of alignment between the partners.<br/><br/>

                After leaving, I created one marketing company that provided services such as: <strong>branding, launches, sales funnels, growth strategies and so on.</strong><br/><br/>

                However, within a few months of operation I began to fall in love with the creative and technical side that the processes required.<br/><br/>

                Passions that led me to programming and made me find a market where learning, being creative and technical <strong>are all in one place.</strong>
